# Paper Claims Draft

1. atlasmtl improves reliability in multi-level annotation by combining MTL and abstention.
2. Coordinate-aware low-confidence correction improves difficult-cell performance with lower compute than all-cell KNN.
3. AnnData-native API improves practical adoption and reproducibility.

Positioning constraint:

- The paper should frame atlasmtl primarily as a reliable reference mapping and
  label transfer method.
- Do not frame the core contribution as "state-of-the-art integrated latent
  embedding quality" unless the project explicitly adopts new integration-first
  benchmarks and methods.

TODO:
- Link each claim to benchmark table/figure IDs.
