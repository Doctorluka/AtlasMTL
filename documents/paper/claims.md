# Paper Claims Draft

1. atlasmtl improves reliability in multi-level annotation by combining MTL and abstention.
2. Coordinate-aware low-confidence correction improves difficult-cell performance with lower compute than all-cell KNN.
3. AnnData-native API improves practical adoption and reproducibility.

TODO:
- Link each claim to benchmark table/figure IDs.
