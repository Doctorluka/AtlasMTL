# atlasmtl Benchmark Protocol

The stable protocol documentation now lives in:

- `documents/protocols/experiment_protocol.md`

Use that file for:

- dataset manifest schema
- benchmark output schema
- metric definitions
- traceability requirements
- the current list of protocol gaps against the roadmap

This file remains only as a short pointer to avoid duplicate protocol text in
two places.
