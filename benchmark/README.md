# Benchmark

This directory stores reproducible benchmark pipelines.

- `datasets/`: dataset descriptors and mapping tables.
- `methods/`: wrappers for baseline methods.
- `pipelines/`: end-to-end benchmark runners.
- `metrics/`: metric implementations.
- `reports/`: generated tables/figures.

Primary phase-1 focus:
- multi-level classification quality
- calibration and abstention quality
- low-confidence-gated efficiency gains
